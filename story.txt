In the present Betty is a young scientist on the brink of discovering time travel. 
She isolates herself in an underground bunker to do her research. 
Meanwhile, the world around her was on the verge of human extinction. 
She spent countless decades trying to decipher the complex nature of time until she accidentally invented a device capable of time travel. 
It sent her spiralling into the dangerous future stranded and alone.

Betty’s first moments in the future were disorienting. 
As she wandered through the ruins of what was once a thriving city, she realized something horrifying — the human race was extinct.  
The towering buildings had crumbled and were covered in vines. 
Creatures once deemed inferior like cockroaches had evolved into horrific beasts. 
As she sprinted for shelter, her mind was racing to fix the device that had stranded her. 
Days turned into weeks, but finally, she managed to reassemble the machine.  
Desperate to escape she activated the device with hopes of returning to her present life. 
Instead, the world blurred around her. 
When she came to, she found herself standing in her past, years before her time-travel experiments had even begun.

Betty frantically sought out the world’s leaders, desperate to warn them of the impending catastrophe. 
She explained how humanity could avoid extinction and shared her knowledge of the future collapse. \
However, her warnings fell on deaf ears. The authorities dismissed her as delusional, 
branding her stories of time travel as nothing more than science fiction. Instead of being hailed as a hero for 
trying to save the planet, Betty was condemned. 
She was locked away in a mental institution, forced to live out her days tormented by the knowledge of the 
inevitable future she could not prevent.

To her surprise, she heard a loud ringing sound, it came from her alarm clock. Turns out it was only a dream!!
